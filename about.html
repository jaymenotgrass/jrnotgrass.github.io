    <h3> Get To Know Me:</h3>
    <d1>
        <dt>Childhood:</dt>
        <br>
        <dd>I grew up in a small town called Farmington, New Mexico, where I was raised by my dad and mom alongside my two older sisters. Since I was born, we have always had animals to care for; in total, my parents have had 4 mules and 3 dogs over the last 20 years. From kindergarten to seventh grade, I went to a private school where we had a class of about 15 kids and learned the basic subjects of math, science, english, alongside classes about the Bible. I transitioned into public school my 8th grade year, and then into high school for the next 4 after that. Through all of this, a huge part of my life revolves around soccer, which I have played since I was 4 years old. </dd>

        <dt>School:</dt>
        <br>
        <dd style="background-color:skyblue;">From K-7th grade, I attended a private school, and then transitioned into public school my 8th grade year. Throughout my 4 years of high school, I learned a lot of great people skills and leadership skills. Being apart of NHS, FCA, and my soccer team gave me some great life lessons graduating out of there in 2023. I signed my letter of intent to go to college at Arizona Christian University, where I study Organizational Leadership with a minor in Computer Programming and Biblical Studies. I am in my sophmore year now, and plan to graduate a semester early.</dd>

        <dt>Hobbies/Interests:</dt>
        <br>
        <dd>When it comes to hobbies, I tend to not know what to put because even though I have interests, I don't do much of those passions consistently to consider it a hobby. However, some of my interests have a lot to do with being outside. I love to ski(as you can see from my picture above), hike, fish, camp, and any type of sports or physical activity/game that I can get involved in. Even though I love the occasional lazy days where I can just lay on the couch and read a good book or watch a funny movie, my heart will always long to be outside.</dd>
